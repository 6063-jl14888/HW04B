In the assignment, we need to demonstrate different shapes that change their position and color as the mouse is clicked or moved.

So, I used three shapes in the code: circles, rectangles, and triangles. I made them change color, shape, and position based on the mouse click. I enjoy the variation in colors.

In this process, I created new functions and made them run: function mouseClicked() and function keyPressed(). 

In mouseClicked(), I defined the intervals for changing shapes and colors. 
  For shapes, I associated their coordinates with mouseX and mouseY to ensure they appear at the click location and assigned random values to ensure both position and shape are random.
  
Initially, I wanted the shapes to appear randomly with each mouse click, for example, one click might display a circle and a triangle, then another click could show a rectangle and a triangle, and so on.

The most challenging part was figuring out how to set the random values. The most interesting part is that every test produces a different pattern randomly.
